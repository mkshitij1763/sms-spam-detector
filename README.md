**Spam Classifier**

---

### Overview:

This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails or SMS messages as spam or not spam (ham). The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and then trains a classifier to make predictions.

---

### Features:

- **Text Preprocessing**: The project preprocesses text data by converting it to lowercase, tokenizing, removing special characters, stopwords, and punctuation, and finally stemming the words.

- **Model Building**: It trains several machine learning models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes using the preprocessed text data.

- **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using accuracy and precision metrics to assess their performance in classifying spam and ham messages.

- **Model Selection**: After evaluating various models, the project selects the best-performing model for deployment based on accuracy and precision scores.

- **Deployment**: The selected model is saved using pickle and can be deployed to classify spam messages in real-time.

### Code Structure:

- **app.py**: Contains the Streamlit application code for user interaction and displaying the classification results.
  
- **model.py**: Includes the code for training and evaluating the machine learning models using the preprocessed text data.
  
- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the models.
  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies and packages required to run the project.

### Usage:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install all the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Execute the Streamlit application to interact with the spam classifier.

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Enter Message**: Input the email or SMS message text into the text area provided in the application.

5. **Predict**: Click the "Predict" button to classify the entered message as spam or not spam.

---

### Future Improvements:

- **Improve Model Performance**: Experiment with different NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to further enhance the model's accuracy and precision.

- **Enhance User Interface**: Add more features and visualizations to the Streamlit application for a better user experience.

- **Support Additional Languages**: Extend the model to support multiple languages for spam classification.

- **Deploy as Web Service**: Deploy the model as a web service for seamless integration into other applications.
